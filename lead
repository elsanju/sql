# LEAD Function 

Using the LEAD() function, from the current row, you can access data of the next row, or the row after the next row, and so on.

The LEAD() function can be very useful for comparing the value of the current row with the value of the following row.

The following shows the syntax of the LEAD() function:

LEAD(return_value ,offset [,default]) 
OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)


SELECT customer_id 
      , LEAD (updated_at,1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY updated_at) 
FROM table
